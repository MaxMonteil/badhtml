# Bad HTML

An example of so many wrong decisions that can be made while making a site. This code is mostly meant to be used during the Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) event at AUB (American University of Beirut) for a workshop on web accessibility. Please never actually use this on any site.

The code was mostly copied from Mozilla here [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)

## Getting Started

Either clone the repo or copy paste the file content into local files on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Any text editor will do but I recommend using something that was meant to be used with code, if you're not sure what to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great editor.
